              learn from the results of scientific research but is notoriously
              challenging in bioinformatics, which often involves large data
              sets and complex analytic workflows involving many different
              tools. Additionally, many biologists are not trained in how to
              effectively record their bioinformatics analysis steps to ensure
              reproducibility, so critical information is often missing.
              Software tools used in bioinformatics can automate provenance

  abstract  = "Background We present q2-boots, a QIIME 2 plugin that facilitates
               bootstrapped and rarefaction-based microbiome diversity analysis.
               This plugin provides eight new actions that allow users to apply
               any of thirty different alpha diversity metrics and twenty-two
               beta diversity metrics to bootstrapped or rarefied feature
               tables, using a single QIIME 2 Pipeline command, or more granular
               QIIME 2 Action commands. Results Given a feature table, an even
               sampling depth, and the number of iterations to perform (n), the
               command qiime boots core-metrics will resample the feature table
               n times and compute alpha and beta diversity metrics on each
               resampled table. The results will be integrated in summary data
               artifacts that are identical in structure and type to results
               that would be generated by applying diversity metrics to a single
               table. This enables all the same downstream analytic tools to be
               applied to these tables and ensures that all collected data is
               considered when computing microbiome diversity metrics.
               Conclusions A challenge of this work was deciding how to
               integrate distance matrices that were computed on n resampled
               feature tables, as a simple average of pairwise distances (median
               or mean) does not account for the structure of distance matrices.
               q2-boots provides three options, and we show here that the
               results of these approaches are highly correlated. q2-boots is
               free and open source. Source code can be found at
               https://github.com/caporaso-lab/q2-boots; installation
               instructions and a tutorial can be found in the project’s
               documentation at https://q2-boots.readthedocs.io.",

              (COVID-19) pandemic, our team hosted our first fully online
              workshop teaching the QIIME 2 microbiome bioinformatics platform.
              We had 75 enrolled participants who joined from at least 25
              different countries on 6 continents, and we had 22 instructors on
              4 continents. In the 5-day workshop, participants worked hands-on
              with a cloud-based shared compute cluster that we deployed for
              this course. The event was well received, and participants
              provided feedback and suggestions in a postworkshop questionnaire.
              In January of 2021, we followed this workshop with a second fully
              online workshop, incorporating lessons from the first. Here, we
              present details on the technology and protocols that we used to
              run these workshops, focusing on the first workshop and then
              introducing changes made for the second workshop. We discuss what
              worked well, what didn't work well, and what we plan to do
