# Microbiome marker gene analysis with QIIME 2

Welcome! üëã

This is the primary documentation introducing the use of QIIME 2 for marker gene (i.e., amplicon) based microbiome analysis.
This site replaces the old QIIME 2 user documentation, `https://docs.qiime2.org`.
If you're looking for content from the old QIIME 2 user documentation, you can find it at https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.10/ (but do [let us know](https://github.com/qiime2/amplicon-docs/issues) what that content is, as we're trying to transition everything that's needed to this site).

## Navigating this documentation

Based on our website analytics, these are the topics users are most frequently looking for in our documentation:

- **New to QIIME 2?**
  We recommend that you read [](explanations/getting-started) for a high-level discussion about what QIIME 2 is and the resources that are available to you for learning.

- **Learning, or just exploring?**
  The [](tutorials/moving-pictures) is the resource that most users start with to learn how to use QIIME 2.
  It's written for readers who are also new to microbiome analysis.
  If you want to try or learn QIIME 2, we recommend starting with the [](tutorials/moving-pictures).
  All of the outputs generated during the tutorial are linked in the tutorial document, so you can also read through it and interact with the results without running any of the commands on your own.
  If you're already familiar with microbiome analysis but new to QIIME 2, we recommend also looking at [](explanations/experienced-researchers) and [](explanations/some-theory).

- **Ready to install QIIME 2?**
  See [](how-to-guides/install).

- **Need information on specific tools?**
  If you're looking for reference material on the plugins and actions installed in the QIIME 2 amplicon distribution, see [](references/available-plugins).
  If you're looking for data resources, such as pre-trained taxonomic classifiers, see our [Data Resources](https://resources.qiime2.org) website.
  If you're looking for other tools available for the QIIME 2 Framework (üå≥), see the [QIIME 2 Library](https://library.qiime2.org).

- **Need help with your metadata?**
  See our documentation of the [Metadata file format](https://use.qiime2.org/en/latest/references/metadata.html).

- **Need to import or export data?**
  See [](how-to-guides/import-export).

- **Need technical support?**
  Head over to the [QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org), where you can browse nearly 10 years of discussion, questions, and answers related to microbiome data science with QIIME 2.
  You can ask your own questions if you don't find existing answers, and give back by answering someone else's questions when you're ready.
  "The Forum" is also where we make important [Announcements](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/announcements/8) - if you register for a (free) account, you can get those announcements by email.
